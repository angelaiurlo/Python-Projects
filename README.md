## Analyzing historical stock data and building a dashboard

In this project I extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are Tesla, AMD, and GameStop.

## Data Analysis
In this course I learned the basis of data analysis and in particular: 
- Develop Python code for cleaning and preparing data for analysis - including handling missing values, formatting, normalizing, and binning data
- Manipulate data using dataframes, summarize data, understand data distribution, perform correlation and create data pipelines
- Perform exploratory data analysis and apply analytical techniques to real-word datasets using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scipy
- Build and evaluate regression models using machine learning scikit-learn library and use them for prediction and decision making

I collected here all my assignments, where I investigated different case-studies and practical examples.
